# Cat-Dog Classification

## Overview
This project is a neural network-based classifier for distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. The classifier is implemented from scratch and the application is built using Streamlit.

## Streamlit App
The `streamlit_app.py` script is the main entry point for running the web application. This application allows users to upload images and get predictions on whether the image is of a cat or a dog.
